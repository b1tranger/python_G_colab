Explanation:\n","\n","1.  **Function Definition**: The function `process_list(my_list)` is defined, specifying `my_list` as its parameter. When you call this function, whatever list you pass to it will be referred to as `my_list` inside the function.\n","2.  **Passing by Reference (Implicitly)**: In Python, when you pass a mutable object like a list to a function, you are essentially passing a reference to that object. This means that if you modify the list *inside* the function (e.g., using `append()`, `remove()`, etc.), those changes will be reflected in the original list outside the function. This is demonstrated by the `my_numbers` list being modified after `process_list` is called."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"def637e1"},"source":["You can achieve something similar to C++'s fixed-size array input in Python, though Python lists are dynamically sized.
