### # Guide/suggestions on transition to AI route
- [@zobayersq](https://github.com/zobayersq): <br> 
> "Learn basic python (freecodecamp) &rarr; very basics of ML (grameenphone academy, freecodecamp) (learn by doing a project) &rarr; basics of gen AI (cs50 AI, freecodecamp, inception bd) &rarr; coose a part of AI and start research"
- [@SamudraJS](https://github.com/SamudraJS) : <br> 
>"Do 50 problem solves on CodeForces, get used to Python, then we will talk about AI. Almost everything can be done with Python now." <br> 
>"follow the course [CS 188 Spring 2025](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp25/) for AI"
